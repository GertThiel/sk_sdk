= SalesKing SDK

A bunch of classes to get a quick start creating SalesKing App's, using oAuth
and the API.


== Install

  gem install sk_sdk

Dependencies (gem's):

* activesupport
* activeresource
* curb

  require 'sk_sdk/oauth'
  require 'sk_sdk/base'

=== API client

Uses ActiveResource to CRUD SalesKing object's {see usage in README}[https://github.com/salesking/sk_sdk/blob/master/lib/sk_sdk/README_Base.rdoc]

=== oAuth

Handling oAuth related URL's and getting an access token.
There also is an omniAuth strategy in case you are using it.
